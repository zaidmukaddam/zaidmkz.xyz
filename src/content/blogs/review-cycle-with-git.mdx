## The thought

It was a normal working day, I was about to review an important PR when Bitbucket went down.
It was the genesis moment for this thought ðŸ¤”

> What happens to the PR review cycle in a non-GitHub world?

## The answer

After a few minutes, Bitbucket was up and running, but the thought was still alive. I did some
research + thinking and came to the following steps that one can follow if something urgent comes up!

### 1. Branch to be reviewed

Checkout to the branch you want to review, Assume the feature branch is named as `feature-branch`.
On this branch, execute:

```bash
git checkout -b review-branch
```

As the `review-branch` is based on `feature-branch` it will have everything that we need to review.

### 2. Get the diff

You all must be aware of [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff), it is used to compare two branches. Execute the following
with the branch, you want to compare it with.

```bash
git diff base-branch review-branch
```

> Note: The `base-branch` can be master/main or devel, depending on your project structure.

The diffed output with git added/removed lines notation will be thrown on the terminal. It may or may not be user-friendly ðŸ’€.
Skim through the changed files, select a suitable line above the change where you want to add the review comment.
Type the following:

```bash
// Review-comment - Hey please change 1+1 = 3 to 1+1 = 2, thanks!
```

Add, commit, and push the review changes in a fixed format with an identifier (for eg Review-comment) and handover
the branch to the reviewee.

### 3. Let it grep

The `git grep` is pretty interesting and powerful, and I hope you would have guessed its usage here.
Reviewee just has to grep the review comment identifier to get the list of all the review comments.

```bash
git grep 'Review-comment'
```

From here onwards, the changes can be pushed to the `review-branch`. Then we can merge the `review-branch` into the `feature-branch` and
get that merged further into the `base-branch`.

## Conclusion

There may exist numerous other ways to do the review cycle without git management systems.
This is just what I thought of as a possible solution. If you can think of other ways, do let me know!
Also, writing this blog made me realize how important these git management systems are ðŸš€.

> Thanks and happy reviewing!
