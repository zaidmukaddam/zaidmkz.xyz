I love building products using React + TypeScript. To sum it up, I basically make and break frontends. Apart from JS, I can code in python, golang, dart and javascript too.

Stuff I am currently dealing/learning:

- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) & [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/)

I love open-source ‚ù§Ô∏è a lot and I am always looking for new ideas for social causes.

To view my contributions, you can head over to my GitHub.

I&apos;ll be honest with you, I needed an excuse to get my hands on Next JS, TypeScript
and styled-components, that&apos;s why I revamped this app and also due to my sudden
urge to write blogs üññ

I like music a lot, notice the Spotify icon in the footer? Yes it'll show my currently playing song.
